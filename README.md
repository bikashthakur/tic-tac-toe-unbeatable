# tic-tac-toe-unbeatable
It's a simple AI based game where a Human player plays against the Bot. The bot plays each move perfectly.
(a move is perfect if it leads to either draw or win.) It uses Game Theory's minimax algorithm to choose the perfect move out of all the possible moves.
And thus algorithm ensures that the bot never looses.
